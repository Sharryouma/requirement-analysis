# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that focuses on understanding, documenting, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders. This repository provides an overview of Requirement Analysis concepts, activities, and methodologies, using a booking management system as a case study.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and managing the requirements of a software system. It serves as the foundation for the design, development, and deployment phases of the SDLC.

### Importance in the SDLC:
- Ensures that the final product meets stakeholder expectations.
- Prevents misunderstandings by defining clear and actionable requirements.
- Minimizes the risk of costly changes during later phases of development.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. **Improved Communication**:
   Requirement Analysis facilitates clear communication among stakeholders, developers, and designers, ensuring everyone is aligned on the project goals.

2. **Efficient Resource Allocation**:
   By prioritizing requirements, resources such as time, budget, and personnel are allocated effectively to essential features.

3. **Reduction of Scope Creep**:
   Well-defined requirements help in avoiding unnecessary changes during development, keeping the project on track.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. **Requirement Gathering**:
   - Collecting requirements through interviews, surveys, workshops, and document analysis.

2. **Requirement Elicitation**:
   - Refining and elaborating on gathered requirements using brainstorming, prototyping, and stakeholder discussions.

3. **Requirement Documentation**:
   - Creating detailed documents such as requirement specifications, user stories, and use cases.

4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**:
   - Analyzing requirements for feasibility and consistency.
   - Modeling them using diagrams like use case diagrams or flowcharts.

5. **Requirement Validation**:
   - Ensuring requirements are accurate, complete, and approved by stakeholders.

## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements specify the features and functions of the system.

#### Examples for a Booking Management System:
- Users can search for properties by location, price range, and availability.
- Users can book properties and receive confirmation via email.
- Admins can manage property listings.

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define the system's performance, security, and scalability.

#### Examples for a Booking Management System:
- The system must handle 1,000 concurrent users.
- Page load time should not exceed 2 seconds.
- Data should be encrypted to ensure security.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use case diagrams visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system.

### Benefits:
- Provide a clear overview of system functionality.
- Help identify system boundaries and interactions.

### Use Case Diagram for the Booking Management System:

The diagram includes:
- **Actors**: Users and Admins.
- **Use Cases**: Search Property, Book Property, Manage Listings, View Booking History.

## Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria define the conditions a feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders.

### Importance:
- Ensure alignment between stakeholders and the development team.
- Provide a clear definition of done for features.

### Example: Checkout Feature
- The system must allow users to:
  - Select a property and add it to the cart.
  - Choose a payment method (credit card, PayPal, etc.).
  - Receive a booking confirmation upon successful payment.
- The system must notify the user if payment fails and allow retry.
